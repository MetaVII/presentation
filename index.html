				<h1 style="text-align: left;">how browser renders page</h1>
				<p style="text-align: left;">Alexandr Kryzhny</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Hello, I'm Alex and today we going to talk about how browser render pages.</p>
					<p>It's important, because when you’re building web apps, you don’t just write isolated JavaScript code that
						runs on its own.
						JavaScript you write is interacting with the environment. Understanding this environment, how it works
						and
						what it is composed of will allow you to build better apps and be well-prepared for potential issues that
						might arise once your apps are released.</p>

				<h3>Browser main components</h3>
				<img src="/img/img1.png" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" />
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>So, let’s see what the browser main components are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>User interface: this includes address bar, back and forward buttons, bookmarking menu, etc. In
							essence, this is every part of the browser display except for the window where you see the web page
							itself.</li>
						<br />
						<li>Browser engine: it handles interactions between user interface and rendering engine</li>
						<br />
						<li>Rendering engine: it’s responsible for displaying web page. Rendering engine parses HTML and
							CSS and displays the parsed content on the screen.</li>
						<br />
						<li>Networking: these are network calls such as XHR requests, and, generally, browser communication with
							the rest of internet, including proxying, caching, and so on. </li>
						<br />
						<li>UI backend: it’s used for drawing core widgets such as checkboxes and windows. This backend exposes
							a
							generic interface that is not platform-specific. It uses operating system UI methods underneath.</li>
						<br />
						<li>JavaScript engine: this is where JavaScript code gets parsed and executed.</li>
						<br />
						<li>Data persistence: if your app might need to store data locally, it can use different types of
							storage
							mechanisms, include localStorage, indexDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In this talk, we’re going to focus on rendering engine, since it is handling parsing and visualization of
						HTML and CSS, which is something that most JavaScript apps are constantly
						interacting
						with.</p>

				<h3>Constructing the DOM tree</h3>
				<img src="/img/img2.png" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" />
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Rendering engine receives contents of requested document from networking layer.</p>
					<p>First step of rendering engine is parsing the HTML document and converting the parsed elements to
						actual DOM nodes in a DOM tree.</p>
					<p>Imagine you have the following textual input, like on the left</p>
					<p>The DOM tree for this HTML will look like the one on the right</p>
					<p>Basically, each element is represented as the parent node to all of the elements, which are directly
						contained inside of it. And this is applied recursively.</p>
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Constructing the CSSOM tree</h3>
				<img src="/img/img3.png" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" />
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Next step is Constructing CSSOM tree</p>
					<br />
					<p>CSSOM refers to CSS Object Model. While browser was constructing DOM of the page, it
						runs upon a link tag in head section which was referencing external CSS style sheet.
						Expecting that it might need that resource to render page, it immediately dispatched a request for
						it. Let’s imagine that CSS file has the contents like on this slide</p>
					<br />
					<p>As with the HTML, engine needs to convert CSS into something that browser can work with — the
						CSSOM. Here you can see how CSSOM tree will look like:</p>
					<br />
					<p>You may ask, why does CSSOM have a tree structure? When computing the final set of styles for any
						object on page, browser starts with the most general rule applicable to that node (for example, if
						it is a child of a body element, then all body styles apply) and then recursively refines computed
						styles by applying more specific rules.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Let’s work with specific example that we gave. Any text contained within a span tag that is placed
						within body element, has a font size of 16 pixels and has a red color. Those styles are inherited from
						body element. If a span element is a child of a p element, then its contents are not displayed due to
						more specific styles that are being applied to it.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Also, note that above tree is not complete CSSOM tree and only shows styles we decided to
						override in our style sheet. Every browser provides a default set of styles also known as “user agent
						styles” — that’s what we see when we don’t explicitly provide any. Our styles simply override these
						defaults.</p>

				<h3>Constructing render tree</h3>
				<img src="/img/img4.png" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" />
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Visual instructions in HTML, combined with styling data from CSSOM tree, are being used to
						create a render tree.</p>
					<p>What is a render tree? This is a tree of visual elements constructed in order in which
						they will be displayed on the screen. It is the visual representation of HTML along with corresponding CSS.
						The purpose of this tree is to enable painting contents in their correct order.</p>
					<p>Each node in render tree is known as a renderer or a render object in Webkit.</p>
					<p>You can see how render tree of the above DOM and CSSOM trees will look like</p>
					<p>To construct render tree, browser does roughly the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Starting at the root of DOM tree, it moves through each visible node. Some nodes are not visible
							(for
							example, script tags, meta tags, and so on), and are omitted since they are not reflected in rendered
							output. Some nodes are hidden via CSS and are also omitted from render tree. For example, span
							node — in the example above it’s not present in the render tree because we have an explicit rule that sets
							display: none property on it.</li>
						<li>For each visible node, browser finds the appropriate matching CSSOM rules and applies them.</li>
						<li>It emits visible nodes with content and their computed styles</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Each renderer represents a rectangular area usually corresponding to a node’s CSS box. It includes
						geometric info such as width, height, and position.</p>

				<h3>Layout and Painting the render tree</h3>
				<img src="/img/img5.png" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" />
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>When renderer is created and added to tree, it does not have a position and size. Calculating these
						values is called layout.</p>
					<p>HTML uses a flow-based layout model, meaning that most of time it can compute geometry in a single
						pass.</p>
					<p>Layout is a recursive process — it begins at root renderer, which corresponds to &lthtml&gt
						element of
						HTML document. Layout continues recursively through a part or entire renderer hierarchy, computing
						geometric info for each renderer that requires it.</p>
					<p>
						Starting layout process means giving each node exact coordinates where it should appear on screen.
					</p>
					<h3>Next stage is Painting render tree</h3>
					<p>In this stage, renderer tree is traversed and renderer’s paint() method is called to display content on
						screen.</p>
					<p>Painting can be global or incremental (similar to layout):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Global — it is when entire tree gets repainted, and</li>
						<li>Incremental — it's when only some of renderers change in a way that does not affect entire tree.
							renderer invalidates its rectangle on screen. This causes OS to see it as a region that needs
							repainting and to generate a paint event. Operating System does it in a smart way by merging several
							regions into
							one.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In general, it’s important to understand that painting is a gradual process. For better UX, rendering
						engine will try to display contents on screen as soon as possible. It will not wait until all the
						HTML is parsed to start building and laying out render tree. Parts of content will be parsed and
						displayed, while process continues with rest of content items that keep coming from network.

				<h3>Optimizing the rendering performance</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">JavaScript</li>
					<li class="fragment">Style calculations</li>
					<li class="fragment">Layout</li>
					<li class="fragment">Paint</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Now, let's talk about how can you optimize your application.</p>
					<p>If you’d like to optimize your app, there are four major areas that you need to focus on. These are
						areas over which you have control:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>First is JavaScript. - When it comes to rendering, we need to think about the way your JavaScript code
							will
							interact with DOM elements on page. JavaScript can create lots of changes in UI, especially in
							SPAs.</li>
						<li>Next one is style calculations - Modifying DOM through adding and removing elements, changing
							attributes, etc.
							will make th browser recalculate element styles and, in many cases, layout of entire page or at
							least a part of it.
							<p>To optimize rendering, you can do following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Reduce complexity of your selectors. Selector complexity can take more than 50% of time
									needed to calculate styles for an element, compared to rest of the work which is constructing
									the style itself.</li>
								<li>Reduce number of elements on which style calculation must happen. In essence, make style changes
									to a few elements directly rather than invalidating page as a whole.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Next area is Layout. Layout re-calculations can be very heavy for You can:
							<ul>
								<li>Reduce number of layouts whenever possible. When you change styles, browser checks if
									any of changes require layout to be re-calculated. Changes to properties such as width,
									height, left, top, and in general, properties related to geometry, require layout. So, avoid changing
									them as much as possible.</li>
								<li>Use flexbox over older layout models whenever possible. It works faster and can create a huge
									performance advantage for your app.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Last ares is Paint. This often is the longest-running of all tasks so it’s important to avoid it as
							much as
							possible. Here is what we can do:
							<ul>
								<li>Changing any property other than transforms or opacity triggers a paint. Use it sparingly.</li>
								<li>If you trigger a layout, you will also trigger a paint, since changing geometry results in a
									visual change of the element, so you should think twice before using it.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
